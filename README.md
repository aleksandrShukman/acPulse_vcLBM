# acPulse_vcLBM
This C++ code implements the Lattice Boltzmann Method based on an athermal D3Q19 velocity set and served as a foundation in a study of spurious acoustic reflexions created by the interaction of a Gaussian acoustic pulse and vertex-centered grid refinement interface, located in the middle of a quasi-2D domain.
